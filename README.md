Steps to get the listing-service build running
1. Find the two .env.example files inside the main project folder and also inside the listing-service folder. Create a .env matching those variables.
2. In a terminal at the main project directory. Run in the terminal:
make up
3. If everything went well then you can import the postman.json in listin-service to see how to interact with it. Do note that the baseurl uses localhost:8081 and you need to define the port yourself in the global .env
